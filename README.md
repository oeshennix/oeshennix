## More about me
started off roblox studio 5 years ago(I hate telling people about this).

doing javascript for about 3 years but haven't look super deep into it.

Vim user.  I got tricked, now I can't stop using it as it feels too good.


I have been trying to learn:
C++, Rust, python, at&t/unix asm.
