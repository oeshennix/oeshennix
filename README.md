# Oeshen Nix
A javascript developer who basically does nothing, **BUT!**
### I have achieved
* Working discordbot
* Chrome extension
* WebGPU
* basic crappy *express* project

## More about me
started off roblox studio 7 years ago (2018, I hate telling people about this).
doing javascript for about 6 years (2019) but haven't look super deep into it.
C++ 6 months (2024)

neovim user.  I got tricked, now I can't stop using it as it feels too good.

I now see the headache of javascript. so I have started to use to lua and C++ more often (but still use javascript for web apps).  So you'll see alot more lua contributions from me or even C++ repositories.
I do not write code much nowadays so I guess we'll have to find out.

I have been trying to learn:
C++, Rust, python, at&t/unix asm.
